        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I’m a <b>Mechanical Engineer</b> passionate about connecting hardware
          with intelligent software systems to develop high-performance,
          reliable, and scalable products. My background includes
          <b>Mechanical Design, Robotics Development, and System Integration</b>
          in automotive and aerospace sectors, where precision, efficiency, and
          innovation are essential.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Over the years, I’ve contributed to aerospace hardware, robotic system
          prototypes, mechatronic assemblies, and simulation-driven design
          optimizations that improve product reliability and reduce development
          cycles. I’m skilled in
          <b>SolidWorks, CATIA, Ansys, MSC Nastran, MSC Patran, MATLAB,</b> with
          practical experience in
          <b>ROS, Python, C++, Control Systems, and Automation</b>, enabling me
          to design mechanisms that integrate smoothly with electronic and
          AI-driven systems.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I’m motivated by challenges that push boundaries in
          <b
            >Aerospace, Automotive, and Robotics, AI-based Automation, and
            next-generation product design</b
          >—blending creativity, engineering expertise, and data-driven
          decisions.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
    My personal values are deeply rooted in
    <b>integrity, curiosity, resilience, and impact</b>. I believe engineering is not
    just about solving problems—it’s about creating systems that make the
    world more <b>efficient, sustainable, and connected</b>. I value
    <b>precision and accountability</b> in every task, and I approach
    challenges with a mindset of
    <b>continuous learning and innovation</b>. Collaboration and
    knowledge-sharing are central to how I work, as I believe the best
    ideas emerge when disciplines intersect and people think collectively.
    Above all, I’m driven by a sense of purpose—to engineer solutions that
    move industries forward and contribute meaningfully to both
    <b>technological and environmental progress</b>.
